## Introduction
<a id="introduction"></a>
In the Maven Market Data Analyst project, I created an interactive dashboard containing 3 pages: Topline performance, product details, and customer details. This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for analyzing key metrics and trends in sales, product performance, and customer behavior.

## Data Journey

The data journey began with the foundational steps of cleaning and transforming the raw data, ensuring its readiness for analysis. Subsequently, we established relationships between the various tables to unlock deeper insights into the dataset. Finally, we culminated our efforts in the creation of an interactive dashboard that encapsulates the essence of the data, allowing users to explore and understand its nuances effortlessly.
